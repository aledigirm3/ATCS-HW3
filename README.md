# Neural Table Rapresentation

SQL is a powerful and scalable language for working
with relational databases. However, users may encounter scenarios that require more
sophisticated operations tasks (that go beyond the declarative and rule-based structure
of SQL). 
SQL can be complemented by Large Language Models (LLMs), however this integration introduces several challenges. The use of LLMs may lead to
inconsistent or inaccurate outputs due to their probabilistic nature. 
Additionally, the computational cost is significantly higher compared to traditional SQL queries, and the
solution may not scale as efficiently as pure SQL-based approaches.
