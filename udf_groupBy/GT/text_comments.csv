"1","Could be a poster child fo argumentative and subjective.  At the least, need to define 'valuable'."
"2","Yes, R is nice- but WHY is it 'valuable'."
"3","Again- why?  How would I convince my boss to use this over, say, Excel."
"4","It's mature, well supported, and a standard within certain scientific communities (popular in our AI department, for example)"
"5","Define ""valuable""..."
"6","why ask the question here?  All are community-wiki, why not just fix the canonical answer?"
"7","also the US census data http://www.census.gov/main/www/access.html"
"9","Andrew Gelman has a nice R library that links Bugs to R."
"10","I am not sure I understand the difficulty. If the functional form is known just take the derivative otherwise take differences. Am I missing something here?"
"11","There are many R GUI's available for Windows, so I'm not following your point."
"12","That's just an example - it might have a median that is much smaller, on the order of 200 (it depends on how I partition the data). That would preclude using a normal distribution, right?"
"13","What levels of kurtosis and skewdness are acceptable to meet the assumption of normality?"
"14","this is an incredibly unclear response. Please try to write in English."
"15","Maybe the focus shouldn't be on ""valuable"" but rather ""pros"" and ""cons"" of each project?"
"16","Probably better asked on meta.  People feel like they have to downvote it because it is an off-topic question.  But then the downvotes make it look like staticians have no sense of humor :("
"18","http://xkcd.com/552/"
"19","@Jason Punyon in particular gets a humorless downvote for removing my ""verboten"" tag! ;-)"
"20","I am not sure if characterizing one or the other as the 'wrong' formula is the way to understand the issue. It is just that the second one is 'better' in in the sense that it is an unbiased estimator of the true standard deviation. So, if you care about unbiased estimates then the second one is 'better'/'correct'."
"21","I like the first example you give. That will certainly get the students talking ;)"
"22","I like the analogy. I would find it very useful if there were a defined question (based on a dataset) in which an answer was derived using frequentist reasoning and an answer was derived using Bayesian - preferably with R script to handle both reasonings. Am I asking too much?"
"23","-1 for wikipedia cut and paste"
