<h2><b> Time heals all wounds, but  ultimately kills the organism....</b></h2>

<p>-- paraphrased Hector Berlioz quote</p>

<h2>""Lloyd-Webber's awful stuff<br>
Runs for years and years and years<br>
An earthquake hits the theatre<br>
But the operetta lingers<br>
Then the piano lid comes down<br>
And breaks his fucking fingers<br>
It's a miracle"" - Roger Waters</h2>

<p><br></p>

<h2>What God Wants God Gets</h2>

<p><br> Succinctness is Godliness<br>
<p> oh and just in case anyone is wondering:<br/><br/>
<b>ennui</b> - interminable boredom<br/>
<b>killer</b> - a person or thing that kills<br/><br/>
<b>ennuikiller</b> - a person who kills interminable boredom</p>

<p><p>About the avatar:
<p>It is in memory of 2 of the greatest geniuses of the 20th century (or perhaps in any century).  </p>

<p><p>1. Peter Sellers whose comic genius inspired a whole slew of successful comedians and what better accomplishment to leave to the world than laughter!!</p>

<p><p> 2.Stanley Kubrick whose films have been both iconoclastic and <b>profoundly humanistic</b> (I think some may have missed this point).  I believe his crowning achievement is in fact <b>Dr. Strangelove</b> who is pictured in the avatar.  A dark comedy (but with very serious overtones) about the ease with which the human species can eradicate itself.  If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and watch it RIGHT NOW!</p>
