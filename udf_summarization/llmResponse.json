        "summary": "CyberQuest: Dark Horizon presents a mixed landscape of player experiences, marked by both potential and significant shortcomings. While the game's world-building and music are notable highlights, with the latter being consistently praised, several issues detract from the overall experience. Technical problems such as frequent bugs, crashes, and glitches are prominent, creating frustration and disrupting gameplay. The combat mechanics and controls, particularly for keyboard and mouse users, are often described as clunky and unresponsive, affecting playability. \n\nThe game's visual and auditory aspects are underwhelming, with outdated graphics and flat sound design that lacks impact. Server disconnects and lag in multiplayer mode further diminish the online experience. Players also criticize the game's design, citing a confusing UI, an overly complicated skill tree, and repetitive, unvaried quests that lack meaningful choices. The presence of numerous microtransactions in a full-priced game is another point of contention.\n\nDespite patches, the game remains frustrating for many, with long load times and a general sense of being unfinished or rushed to market. However, the enjoyable music and some engaging missions offer glimpses of what could have been. Overall, while \"CyberQuest: Dark Horizon\" shows promise, its numerous issues and lack of content leave players feeling let down and eager for improvements."
